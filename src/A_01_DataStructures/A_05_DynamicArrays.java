        /*
        ArrayLists = Manipulation with ArrayList is slow
            because it internally uses an array.
            If any element is removed from the array,
            all the other elements are shifted in memory.
            ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.

        Advantages ?
            1. Random access of elements O(1)
            2. Good locality of reference and data cache utilization
            3. Easy to insert/delete AT THE END

         Disadvantages ?
            1. Wastes more memory than a LinkedList
            2. Shifting elements is time-consuming O(n)
            3. Expanding/Shrinking the arrays is also time-consuming 0(n)

         Uses ?
            1.
            2.
            3.
